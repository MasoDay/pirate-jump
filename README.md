Robust 2-D platformer game made using PyGame, sprites, and animations.

I started this game from a tutorial by Clear Code on YouTube for the bones of the project.
I then added lots of customization and various unique animations.

Day 1 - December 12
Initial setup, spent a bit of time picking which tutorial to follow and game to build.

Day 2 - December 13
Worked for 4-5 hours on it, 1.5 of which were spent fixing a file path issue for where my animation images are stored.

Day 2 - December 14
Started early and making great progress. Collisions, additional animations, feels like player movement is serioisly coming together.
